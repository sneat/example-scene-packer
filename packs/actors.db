Here we will view the commonalities of what would be considered the “bandit” class of criminal. Be advised while reviewing this information that not all bandits should be viewed with a scornful eye. While many seek harm or riches from their quarry, others thieve to survive in a world most unfair.</p>\n<p><strong>The Good.</strong> We begin with those bandits who could be seen as “noble criminals”. These bandits consist of the most downtrodden of our nations, those citizens who have struggled through poverty and oppression to scrape out a meager existence clinging to any comfort they can grasp. Consider what would drive a person to commit something so desperate as robbery or open theft in a village street. Bandits of a nobler sort may still be selfish with their earnings, taking what they have stolen to enrich their own lives or those of immediate relations. There are some bandits, however, who seek to use their pilfered goods to improve the lives of the poorer community. Be aware that often these bandits are desperate and afraid, especially during the act of robbery. They are scared, driven to crime by poor circumstances, so they may not require violence to disperse as more often than not they will not physically harm their victims. Keep an open mind as you travel through the world young adventurer and remember that were the tables turned, you may wish for mercy for such a minor infraction.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad and Ugly.</strong> For every good-hearted soul stealing from those with too much and giving to the unfortunate, there is a truly villainous spirit lurking behind the brush of a nearby road, lying in wait for an unsuspecting victim. During your travels, adventurer, these sorts may be the most common instances of banditry you will experience. Armed with swords, clubs, and bows, the more nefarious of the bandit world prefer to ambush their prey from the shadows of hills and trees, catching traveling parties unaware. These treacherous thieves will attempt diversion and trickery in order to catch their quarry off guard should their crew be outnumbered. Bandits have no boundaries of borders or locale, so caution should be taken whether you walk upon a forested road or sail the high seas as you island hop for fame. Danger lurks in every corner of our world adventurer, be prepared and discerning should you encounter a party of brigands lest your career end well before your legend is written.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any Non-Lawful","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":null,"cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 343","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.n4TEv7inVUkyZviN"},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"Actor.PcRWs10BM4P5UEL7"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/BanditRedM.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Bandit","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/BanditRedM.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"47jmKPj5qfteu9HW","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"4oIyAj7rN5JbTjDZ","name":"Scimitar","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+3 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

I strayed from my mentor, a priest in his middle years with a soft voice and ring of grey-dappled hair about a balding head, to approach a statue set aside within a shadowed alcove.&nbsp; It depicted our god in his humanoid form, an elderly man standing strictly at attention, his wild hair hanging as long as his chest length beard, a staff topped with a stern faced sun clutched in his hand.&nbsp; I knelt, still only fourteen, before this statue and began to pray right then.&nbsp; The next six years of my acolyte training would be nothing but a blessing, I knew.&nbsp;<br><em>“The Gleaming Star”, by Bishop Bernard Portis.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Acolytes are those devoted followers of a particular goddess or god who have decided to take on the mantle of the clergy to better serve their chosen deity.&nbsp; Often no older than teenagers (though some acolytes begin later in their lives) acolytes are trained for a number of years (typically between three to ten) depending on the strictures of their deity’s doctrines.&nbsp; During their time they memorize and study all written materials concerning their deity and their teachings, learn magics (be they healing or harmful) gifted to the acolytes by their deities, and often go out into their community to provide aid to those in need or proselytize the words of their goddess or god.&nbsp; Though not every acolyte climbs the ranks into full fledged priesthood, many remain highly dedicated to the church and remain to serve as life-long acolytes working closely with the lay community outside the temple walls.</p>\n<p>Recall that acolytes are trained in the arcane ways of their chosen deities.&nbsp; This being the case, acolytes rarely receive sufficient martial training in comparison to the paladin ranks of the temple (unless expressly dictated otherwise by their deity’s teachings).&nbsp; This being the case, the acolyte is able to unleash some basic divine magic in order to both defend themselves and allies or to call upon their patron deity for aid for injured parties.&nbsp; Typically expelled in a gleaming shower of golden sparks and dazzlingly vibrant lights, the magic of the gods is truly something special, even at such a base nature.&nbsp; Spells such as Cure Wounds, Sacred Flame, or Sanctuary are all practiced by acolytes early on into their divine studies.&nbsp; Acolytes can make handy allies should you be in need of divine protection or a field medic for an injured compatriot.&nbsp; Be sure to mind your acolyte well, however, as their spellwork can easily be interrupted if they are forced into a melee fight with a band of slavering gnolls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":null,"cr":0.25,"spellLevel":1,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 342","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"Any one language (usually common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":14,"prof":2,"total":4},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":1,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":2,"override":2,"max":2},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.CHEUjiYrVM9X0vIT"},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"Actor.fHybExaREAevBVr8"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Acolyte.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Acolyte","displayName":0,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Acolyte.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"4gZVjzzIRXpT208t","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"38I6bGoguRRefN6W","name":"Spellcasting","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>The acolyte is a 1st-level spellcaster.
